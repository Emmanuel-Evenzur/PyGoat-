    <h1>Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</h1>
    
    <div class="box">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>When a developer uses a piece of code or library which already has a known vulnerability, then
           this may result in compromise of the entire application. This occurs when the components such as libraries
           and frameworks used within the app mostly execute with full privileges. If a vulnerable component is
           exploited, it makes the hacker's job easier to cause a serious data loss or server takeover.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation.</li>
                <li>Only obtain components from official sources over secure links.</li>
                <li>Monitor for libraries and components that are unmaintained or do not create security patches for older versions.</li>
                <li>Use Library scanners to test for vulnerabilities in packages.</li>
